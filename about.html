    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, I’m Rabia Hamidova, an IT student at ADA University.
        I was a finalist in RFO Math 2024.
        I have strong skills in Python, C#, mathematics, and social media management.
        I am also very good at literature. Sometimes I write stories and poems. It helps me to relax.
    </p>
    <p>
        My goal is to become a professional software developer and continuously
        improve my technical and problem-solving abilities. I am also interested in AI developing. I want to continue learning new programming languages and frameworks to enhance my development skills. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My another goal is to continue my education in the UK.
    </p> 
    <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy reading books, exploring new technologies,
        and engaging in outdoor activities. 
    </p>
